BigNum.java is the main source class for big integer computation which has a dependency of Num.java.
All code were tested to be right, so you can use them freely.
You can run some examples in Demo.java.
Num.java defines the inner class for BigNum. Certainly you can use Num.java for other uses.
What's more, you can use java.byte to replace java.int in Num.java to save more space.
Polynomial.java is the main source class for big Polynomial computation which works independently.
Sorry for few explaintation in code. But I think you can understand them all easily.
